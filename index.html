						<h2>Personal Portfolio Website - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/sarhuang.github.io" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h2>
					</header>
					
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						The best way to practice front-end development skills is making your own website! 
						Plus, it's a great way to show your projects off visually instead of linking a Github repo.
						In order to get a portfolio site in time for a career fair, I did end up using a template. 
						So shout out to "Astral by HTML5 UP" for the beautiful template because I decided to do this the night before the fair.
						I will be adding my own code to it for now on.
					</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>
						Back to that career fair, I needed to make a portfolio site quick. I wanted to create an easy theme because using the default design would make it clear it's a template.
						Then I thought of Louie Zong's "hello world" song on <a href="https://youtu.be/Yw6u6YkTgQ4?si=ma06zvDWdxQdSos7">Youtube</a>. 
						Just like every other programmer, my first program was getting the console to print out "hello world."
						This website's theme is based on the video's aesthetic.

						<h2>nulltime - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/nullTime-prod" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h2>
					</header>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						My favorite college computer science course was Software Engineering in junior year. I always felt unmotivated to get the weekly/bi-weekly coding assignment done because we would just move on to the next one.
						I wanted a project that I would work on from scratch and for longer duration. And that's what Software Engineering was: a semester-long team project.
						<br><br>
						This project team consisted of me, Harrison Hoytt, Edward Moran, Ryland Seagraves, and Kuba Zeligowski. The idea came from Kuba because he loves games and wanted to make a party game.
						nulltime is essentially a digital version of Fishbowl or Time's Up.
						<br>
						Below is our powerpoint presentation that explains the software:

					<h3>My Contribution</h3>
					<p>
						This project convinced me that I wanted to do front-end development. 
						It was my first experience using Angular, and I haven't used HTML and CSS since high school.
						<b>I was responsible for the game's aesthetic!</b> My inspiration was Kahoot because of its simple and bright look.
						<ul>
							<li>Created the logo and icons in Canva</li>
							<li>Programmed and designed the error modals</li>
							<li>Drew the instruction help pictures</li>
							<li>Chose the background and color scheme</li>
							<li>Chose the game music</li>

					</header>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						This class was definitely a standout in that it is one of the few classes that teach Javascript.
						As someone who really likes coding visual things, this class was a fun creative challenge.
						Big respect to people who enjoy using OpenGL and WebGL because rendering and lighting is not easy.
						<br><br>
						My pride and joy is my final project "Ejected." Inspired by the game Among Us, I wanted to illustrate a story
						of when a player gets voted off the ship and ejected into space. The Among Us model can be moved around while 
						the song "Claire de Lune" by by Claude Debussy plays.

						<h2>Dungeon Dweller - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/Dungeon-Dweller" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h2>
					</header>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>
						The best project I created in high school. In my senior year of high school, we had to create a game with the game engine Greenfoot (meant for education, not real game development).
						The premise is a green slime was captured by a human kingdom and now must escape the dungeon to return back to its forest home.
						It is a simple 2D shooter in which the player must survive until the timer runs out. Additionally, there is a boss fight and cutscenes to flesh out the game.
						Fun fact: this game is based on Ponyu, my very first game I made with my friend.

					<h3>My Contributions</h3>
					This was a two-person project (me and Tyler Blair), and I was in charge of the game aesthetics.
					<ul>
						<li>Designed all character sprites in Pixilart</li>
						<li>Chose backgrounds and game music</li>
						<li>Illustrated the cutscenes</li>
						<li>Programmed the boss fight, enemy behavior, player controls, healthbar, etc.</li>

						<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
						Hi, everyone! My name is Sarah Huang, and welcome to my website! 
						<br>
						You can find my resume here and learn about how I started the path of computer science.
						<br>
						<iframe src="images/pdfs/sarah_huang_resume.pdf" class="image featured" height="400"></iframe>
						<h3>hello past</h3>
						    At six years old, I learned how computer programming  would allow me to design video games just like the ones I was playing on my pink Nintendo Lite DS. 
						With that childhood dream in mind, I took as many computer science courses as my high school schedule would afford and created a few small, amateur video game projects for class. 
						I entered my freshman year at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a strong coding background. 
						Despite the challenges of taking first-year computer science courses asynchronously during the pandemic, my success convinced me that this major was the right choice. 
						The computer science course of study expanded my small pond of childhood dream to the endless sea of computer science opportunities.
						<br>
						<br>
						<h3>hello present</h3>
						While general foundational courses are essential to strengthening my programming background during the first four semesters, the lack of clear specialty areas left me aimless about what I enjoyed and tolerated. 
						During my summer after my sophomore year, my full-time internship at Jewelry Television opened my eyes to the possibility of software engineering competencies such as back-end and front-end autonomous testing, visual testing tools, REST APIs, agile methodologies, and technologies I had not encountered in my coursework. 
						While writing automated front-end tests for the website, I grew to appreciate the human-centered design considerations with the logical navigation flow from browsing to purchasing and overall pleasant visual experience. 
						Witnessing the practical application of software engineering in the workplace started my pivot of being a software engineer after graduation. 
						However, this goal did not feel substantial as I clung to the generalized idea of being a software engineer without any direction of what to do with it.
						<br>
						<br>
						The career direction clicked into place when I designed and coded the front-end of my team's web game for my junior year software engineering course. 
						Developing the game aesthetic, coding the pop-up modal windows to make the site human-centered, and leading the team stand-up meetings helped me realize the satisfaction of programming a visually appealing software product for specific end users in a collaborative environment. 
						My epiphany was that, while I enjoy playing video games, I do not need to design them to be happy. Ultimately, I study computer science because I enjoy coding what I can visually see, and I can do more of what I enjoy by being a software engineer specializing in front-end development. 
						From that revelation, I began taking UI/UX and graphic design classes outside my major to build my personal portfolio website. Despite my efforts, there is little time to thoroughly explore this discovered passion before entering the workforce when the undergraduate computer science curriculum barely has any classes to encourage it.
						<br>
						<br>
						<h3>hello future</h3>
						Already in the Five-Year BS/MS program, I aim to enroll in the online Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) program with a concentration in software 
						engineering to expand my knowledge and skillsets in areas beyond my undergraduate studies.
