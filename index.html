						<h1>Personal Portfolio Website - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/sarhuang.github.io" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h1>
					</header>
					
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						The best way to practice front-end development skills is making your own website! 
						Plus, it's a great way to show your projects off visually instead of linking a Github repo.
						In order to get a portfolio site in time for a career fair, I did end up using a template. 
						So shout out to "Astral by HTML5 UP" for the beautiful template because I decided to do this the night before the fair.
						I will be adding my own code to it for now on.
					</p>
					<h2>Inspiration</h2>
					<p>
						Back to that career fair, I needed to make a portfolio site quick. I wanted to create an easy theme because using the default design would make it clear it's a template.
						Then I thought of Louie Zong's "hello world" song on <a href="https://youtu.be/Yw6u6YkTgQ4?si=ma06zvDWdxQdSos7">Youtube</a>. 
						Just like every other programmer, my first program was getting the console to print out "hello world."
						This website's theme is based on the video's aesthetic.

						<h1>nulltime - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/nullTime-prod" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						My favorite college computer science course was Software Engineering in junior year. I always felt unmotivated to get the weekly/bi-weekly coding assignment done because we would just move on to the next one.
						I wanted a project that I would work on from scratch and for longer duration. And that's what Software Engineering was: a semester-long team project.
						<br><br>
						This project team consisted of me, Harrison Hoytt, Edward Moran, Ryland Seagraves, and Kuba Zeligowski. The idea came from Kuba because he loves games and wanted to make a party game.
						nulltime is essentially a digital version of Fishbowl or Time's Up.
						<br>
						Below is our powerpoint presentation that explains the software:
					</p>
					<!--<iframe src= "pdfs\Nulltime Demo.pdf" class="image featured" height="500"></iframe> -->
					<h2>My Contribution</h2>
					<p>
						This project convinced me that I wanted to do front-end development. 
						It was my first experience using Angular, and I haven't used HTML and CSS since high school.
						<b>I was responsible for the game's aesthetic!</b> My inspiration was Kahoot because of its simple and bright look.
						<ul>
							<li>Created the logo and icons in Canva</li>
							<li>Programmed and designed the error modals</li>
							<li>Drew the instruction help pictures</li>
							<li>Chose the background and color scheme</li>
							<li>Chose the game music</li>

						This class was definitely a standout in that it is one of the few classes that teach Javascript.
						As someone who really likes coding visual things, this class was a fun creative challenge.
						Big respect to people who enjoy using OpenGL and WebGL because rendering and lighting is not easy.
						<br><br>
						My pride and joy is my final project "Ejected." Inspired by the game Among Us, I wanted to illustrate a story
						of when a player gets voted off the ship and ejected into space. The Among Us model can be moved around while 
						the song "Claire de Lune" by by Claude Debussy plays.

						Check out the GitHub repo to see other renderings. I don't know how long my UTK url will last, but those projects can be accessed with this link:

						Some labs have multiple parts so you may want to specifically see lab3, step 1.
						Therefore, it would be https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~shuang24/extended-rundown/lab3/step1

						<h1>Dungeon Dweller - <a href="https://github.com/sarhuang/Dungeon-Dweller" class="fa fa-link"><span>GitHub</span></a></h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						The best project I created in high school. In my senior year of high school, we had to create a game with the game engine Greenfoot (meant for education, not real game development).
						The premise is a green slime was captured by a human kingdom and now must escape the dungeon to return back to its forest home.
						It is a simple 2D shooter in which the player must survive until the timer runs out. Additionally, there is a boss fight and cutscenes to flesh out the game.
						Fun fact: this game is based on Ponyu, my very first game I made with my friend.

					<h2>My Contributions</h2>
					This was a two-person project (me and Tyler Blair), and I was in charge of the game aesthetics.
					<ul>
						<li>Designed all character sprites in Pixilart</li>
						<li>Chose backgrounds and game music</li>
						<li>Illustrated the cutscenes</li>
						<li>Programmed the boss fight, enemy behavior, player controls, healthbar, etc.</li>

						For my AP Computer Science Principles project. I wasn't going to take the exam, but I still needed to submit something.
						So here is a more simple clone of Dungeon Dweller that reused mostly the same code.
						I programmed everything and designed all the sprites and background.
